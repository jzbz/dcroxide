# Quirks ledger

dcrd's behavior at the pinned tag (`release-v2.1.5`) is the specification —
including where it deviates from written documentation (DCPs, `docs/`). Every
intentional reproduction of such a deviation is recorded here, with a test
pinning it so it cannot silently regress.

Entry format:

```
## QK-NNNN — short title

- **Where:** dcrd package / dcroxide crate + item
- **What:** the behavior, and what the docs/spec say instead
- **Why reproduced:** consensus / wire / RPC compatibility rationale
- **Pinned by:** test name(s)
```

## QK-0001 — `reject` messages are write-only

- **Where:** dcrd `wire` (v1.7.5) `makeEmptyMessage` / dcroxide-wire
  `message.rs` read-path dispatch
- **What:** dcrd's message reader has no dispatch case for the `reject`
  command, so received reject frames fail with `ErrUnknownCmd` at *every*
  protocol version — yet `MsgReject` still encodes successfully below
  `RemoveRejectVersion` (9). The written docs describe reject as merely
  "removed as of protocol version 9".
- **Why reproduced:** peers that send a reject frame must observe identical
  accept/reject behavior from dcroxide and dcrd (DoS/ban parity, C2).
- **Pinned by:** `reject_frames_are_unknown_to_readers` in
  `crates/dcroxide-wire/tests/frame_differential.rs` (differential against
  the dcrd oracle).
