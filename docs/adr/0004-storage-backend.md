# ADR-0004 — D1: Storage backend & datadir-compatibility stance

- **Status:** Accepted (decision D1 ratified by the project owner)
- **Date:** 2026-07-03 (proposed), 2026-07-05 (accepted)

## Context

dcrd stores blocks in flat `.fdb` files with goleveldb metadata (`ffldb`),
plus a dedicated UTXO backend and index databases. Compatibility surface C6
(reading an existing dcrd datadir in place) is declared a stretch goal by the
project brief; fresh sync plus a bulk importer is the accepted default.

## Decision

- Implement dcrd's `database` interface semantics (buckets, transactional
  model) as a Rust trait; back it with **`redb`** (pure Rust, no C build
  dependency, crash-safe B-tree, single-file). Keep `rocksdb` as the fallback
  candidate if profiling in Phase 7/8 shows redb cannot sustain sync-time
  write load.
- Block storage: dcrd-style flat files behind the same abstraction (this is
  also what makes an `addblock`-compatible bulk importer/exporter cheap).
- C6 stance: fresh sync default; `addblock`-format import as the migration
  path; ffldb/goleveldb read-compat explicitly out of scope until a
  separately-scheduled stretch milestone.

## Consequences

- No C/C++ toolchain requirement keeps the build simple on all three OS
  tiers and keeps `cargo-vet`/audit scope smaller.
- Crash-consistency test rig (kill -9 during writes) is required regardless
  of backend (Phase 7 exit criterion).
- A Phase 7/8 write-load validation (headers + UTXO batches at sync rates)
  remains a gate before M2: if redb cannot sustain sync-time write load,
  the interface abstraction makes swapping in rocksdb a contained change
  and this ADR gets superseded rather than silently amended.
