# Benchmark ledger

Every performance number this repo relies on, keyed by machine, commit,
and corpus, so any two measurements can be compared — or ruled
incomparable — after the fact. Prose snapshots (README, ADRs) cite
these rows; this file is the record.

Rules: append rows, never rewrite them. A row names the machine (table
below), the dcroxide commit measured, the workload, and where the raw
run lives. Raw exports, logs, and profiles stay out of the tree, under
`/home/jz/zx/dev/artifacts/dcroxide-bench/<machine>/<commit>/` on the
machine that ran them. Record a row for every storage-rework milestone,
so the campaign against the 2.2x IBD gap produces a curve, not
before/after anecdotes.

## Machines

| id | CPU | cores/threads | RAM | disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| m1 | AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 | 16/32 | 64 GB | WD PC SN5000S 1 TB NVMe |

Hardware was not recorded when the 2026-07 campaign ran; its rows are
attributed to m1 as the only bench host to date, with specs read on
2026-08-07.

## Sync throughput

Mainnet genesis to tip over loopback, one machine, fresh datadir per
run, both nodes `--norpc`.

| date | machine | dcroxide commit | vs dcrd | corpus | result | source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07 | m1 | unrecorded (2.2.0-pre, at the ADR-0004 amendment) | 2.2.0-pre+452c1a6c3 (go1.26.5) | mainnet, ~1,100,400 blocks | syncer dcroxide: 2.47 h — 124 blk/s (from dcroxide), 2.51 h — 122 blk/s (from dcrd); syncer dcrd: 1.11 h — 276 blk/s, 1.02 h — 299 blk/s | ADR-0004 amendment |

## Storage at tip

| date | machine | dcroxide commit | corpus | result | source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07 | m1 | unrecorded (2.2.0-pre, at the ADR-0004 amendment) | mainnet tip | dcroxide 32.06 GiB total (17.579 GiB blocks + 14.483 GiB metadata.redb); dcrd 23.73 GiB (17.580 GiB blocks + 6.045 GiB metadata leveldb + 0.108 GiB utxodb) | ADR-0004 amendment |

## Storage decomposition

`dcroxide-bench redbstat`, one JSON object per run. Totals alone hide the
thing under study: a change that moves free pages without moving the file
size is invisible in the table above, and the two have different causes.

Reproduces ADR-0004's amendment, which was produced by a throwaway tool
that is not in the tree — that agreement is what licenses using this
instrument to score the levers.

| date | machine | dcroxide commit | corpus | payload | overhead | slack | free pages | fill |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-07 | m1 | `b49bf92`+ | mainnet tip (baseline-2026-07-25 clone) | 5.65 GiB | 0.69 GiB | 3.44 GiB | 4.69 GiB | 64.86% |

Live tree 9.79 GiB; `accounted_bytes` 15,551,077,894 against a file of
15,551,119,360, so 41,466 bytes of redb header and region metadata are
unexplained and everything else is. The walk takes about 1m53s on this
tree, which is why the per-flush observer samples rather than measuring
every commit.

Note that measuring perturbs: `stats()` exists only on a write
transaction, so each run allocates a little. Two runs against the same
clone moved `allocated_pages` by ~1,000 and free pages by ~2 MiB. Take
each measurement on a fresh clone.

## Preserved baselines

The datadir every figure above was read from, kept because opening a redb
database is not a read-only act (quick-repair on open, and `Database::open`
rolls the block files back when the metadata trails them). Probes open a
fresh reflink clone of the snapshot; neither the original nor the snapshot
is opened directly.

| date | machine | what | path | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-07 | m1 | mainnet datadir behind the 2026-07 sync and storage rows | `artifacts/dcroxide-bench/m1/baseline-2026-07-25/blocks_ffldb/` | reflink clone of `artifacts/p2p-sync/data/mainnet/blocks_ffldb/`, written 2026-07-25; 31 GiB apparent, no additional space on btrfs, 22 s. `metadata.redb` is 15,551,119,360 B, the 14.483 GiB the ADR decomposes. |

## Replay throughput (dcroxide-bench)

Identical-corpus replays via `dcroxide-bench export` / `replay`
(crates/dcroxide-bench). No rows yet — the first storage-rework
milestone starts this table, measured against the corpus the 2026-07
campaign exported.

| date | machine | dcroxide commit | corpus | result | raw run |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Free-page probes (`dcroxide-bench pinprobe`)

Three arms per experiment, each on its own reflink clone, differing only
in what is held open across the flushes.

| date | machine | dcroxide commit | workload | arms | result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-07 | m1 | `6a2951b` | 400k scattered writes, 8 commits, 8 MiB overlay, mainnet clone | none / all / two | Free-page curves identical. Flushes 1-2 byte-for-byte across all arms; flush 3 differs by 41,782 B (0.0008%) between `all` and `none`, in the direction opposite to pinning. Free pages fell 48.5 MiB while payload grew 20.4 MiB and the file did not grow. ADR-0004 lever (a) closed. |

Each sampled flush costs about 206 s here, roughly half of it the
`stats()` tree walk, so a three-arm run is around an hour.

## Flush curves under replay (`dcroxide-bench replay --flushlog`)

Free-page behaviour under real sync churn — updates and deletes, not the
synthetic inserts pinprobe applies.

| date | machine | dcroxide commit | workload | flushes | result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-08 | m1 | `52903af` | 250k mainnet blocks, 1,925,867 regular txs, 100 MiB overlay, `--statsevery 1` | 17 | Free pages are a sawtooth: 0.0 to 994.3 MiB within one run, 0.0% to 96.2% of the allocated file. Spikes are drawn down at ~80 MiB per flush against ~65 MiB of live tree added. Fill ratio is stable at 0.6169-0.6360 while the tree grows 105 MiB to 1.19 GiB. Throughput 745 to 324 blk/s across the run. |
| 2026-08-08 | m1 | `ff36811`+ | full mainnet: 1,100,392 blocks, 7,935,579 regular txs, 100 MiB overlay, `--statsevery 1` | 122 | Free pages 0.0 to 3,983 MiB (0% to 96.2% of file), **ending at 313 MiB / 4.0%** against the live-synced datadir's 4.69 GiB / 32.4%. Fill 0.6169-0.6360 across a 66x tree growth. Flush cost 528 to 2,590 ms (4.9x); stats walk 5 to 6,568 ms (1,302x) — unseparated these would read as a 17.2x commit slowdown. Replay live tree 6.81 GiB vs synced 9.79: `Chain::open` builds no optional indexes. Total 3,271 s at 336 blk/s. |

Raw records: `artifacts/dcroxide-bench/m1/replay-flush-all.jsonl`; corpus
`mainnet-250k.corpus` (2.43 GB, exported from the 2026-07-25 baseline).

The run averaged 445 blk/s where the full mainnet sync managed 124, so
this slice is informative about curve shape and misleading about
magnitude. Raw records for the full run:
`artifacts/dcroxide-bench/m1/full-flush.jsonl`; corpus
`mainnet-full.corpus` (18.87 GB).
